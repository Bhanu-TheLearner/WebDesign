				<p>What is more unfortunate is that these people went to private engineering colleges, spending large sums of their parents earnings (possibly in some cases obtained by sale of land, ornaments of their mothers etc) - to pay the tuition fees to these private colleges. Then they paid large sums to the coaching centers in Delhi and other places away from home for one year or so. The wealthy businessmen run these private institutes. So transfer of wealth (whatever meager wealth many of their parents had) happened from the poor to the rich without any tangible benefit to the students. This is how the wealth transfer from the poor and the middle class to the rich is happening in large scale in India. This needs to stop.   </p>
