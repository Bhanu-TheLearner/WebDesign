				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Last two days I was sitting in our PG admissions interview panel and interviewed more than 30 applicants. Almost all of them had enrolled into coaching centers for the GATE exam. So we decided to ask them very conceptual questions. Some of these applicants also are faculty in private institutes in India, teaching courses such as Computer Organization & Architecture, Database Management, Operating systems etc as per their own admissions. When asked about virtual memory, most of them betrayed a very deep misconception -- that virtual memory is nothing but extra memory beyond the main memory that is allocated to a 'program' when it requires more memory than is available in the RAM. Only about 3 people knew what virtual memory really is for and what is virtual about it. Most of them seem to think that a 'program' and a 'process' is one and the same. Most of them claimed to be good with computer organization and Operating Systems, but they had no idea about the role of program stack and what a context switch entails. The notion of a context seems to baffle them. The ones who are faculty in private engineering colleges, betrayed the most amount of misconception -- one said that he cannot recall anything about 'virtual memory' while he also claimed that he taught "Computer Organization and Architecture" few semesters back. One teacher did not know what a geometric mean of two numbers even mean. Some of them claimed to be good in probability theory but could not explain Bayes' theorem correctly. As more and more applicants were interviewed, all of us on the other side of the table had sinking feeling in our stomachs. While these people have scored well in the GATE exam, their conceptual understanding of computer systems was so weak that it would be very scary if they went to industry and built systems on which our lives depend.</p>

				<p>What is more unfortunate is that these people went to private engineering colleges, spending large sums of their parents earnings (possibly in some cases obtained by sale of land, ornaments of their mothers etc) - to pay the tuition fees to these private colleges. Then they paid large sums to the coaching centers in Delhi and other places away from home for one year or so. The wealthy businessmen run these private institutes. So transfer of wealth (whatever meager wealth many of their parents had) happened from the poor to the rich without any tangible benefit to the students. This is how the wealth transfer from the poor and the middle class to the rich is happening in large scale in India. This needs to stop.   </p>
